UN.R and linegraph.R run cleaning and visualization techniques on UN Database export data. SalesForceHire.R runs data table through analysis of 'multiple hires' that exist within a nonprofit company focused on the post-discharge hiring of veterans. There are a number of clients hired multiple times through the nonprofits work so this code matches these multiple hires by a binary value and their client name so that we can compare their first hire through the program to each subsequent one after that.
